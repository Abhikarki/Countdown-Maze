 A Game in Java with JavaFX library
 
 A 'Countdown Maze in Java. The game terminates when either the player reaches the center or the countdown completes. It has the feature to customize your controls which can be used to increase the difficulty and upon completing, it shows the path of the player.
I have used JavaFX library for the GUI and for collision detection, the player's movements have been restricted to specified coordinates.
