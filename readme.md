 A Game in Java with JavaFX library
 
 A 'Countdown Maze in Java. The game terminates when player reaches the center or the when countdown timer runs out. It has the feature to customize your controls which can be used to increase the difficulty, for instance, you can modify the direction of arrow keys to make the game more challenging. Upon completion, it shows the path of the player.
I have used JavaFX library for the GUI and for collision detection, the player's movements have been restricted to specified coordinates.
